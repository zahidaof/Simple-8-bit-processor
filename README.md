## Simple 8-bit Processor

### Introduction
This project is an implementation of a simple 8-bit processor. The goal of this project is to demonstrate the basic concepts of processor design and to provide a learning platform for students and hobbyists interested in digital design and computer architecture.

### Features
- **8-bit data width**
- **Basic arithmetic and logical operations**
- **Simple instruction set architecture (ISA)**
- **Basic control unit and datapath**
- **Simulation and testing environment**

### Components
- **ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)**: Performs arithmetic and logical operations.
- **Registers**: Temporary storage for data and instructions.
- **Control Unit**: Decodes instructions and controls the datapath.
- **Memory**: Stores instructions and data.
- **Datapath**: The path through which data flows in the processor.

### Getting Started

#### Prerequisites
To work with this project, you will need the following tools:
- **Verilog or VHDL**: For hardware description.
- **ModelSim** or any other compatible simulator: For testing and simulation.

#### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/zahidaof/Simple-8-bit-processor.git
    cd Simple-8-bit-processor
    ```
2. Open the project in your preferred HDL editor or IDE.

#### Running the Simulation
1. Open the simulation tool (e.g., ModelSim).
2. Compile the HDL files.
3. Load the testbench file.
4. Run the simulation and observe the waveforms.

### Usage
1. Write your own instructions and load them into the memory module.
2. Modify the testbench to include your instructions.
3. Run the simulation to see how your instructions are executed by the processor.
