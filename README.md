Simple 8-bit Processor
Introduction
This project is an implementation of a simple 8-bit processor. The goal of this project is to demonstrate the basic concepts of processor design and to provide a learning platform for students and hobbyists interested in digital design and computer architecture.

Features
8-bit data width
Basic arithmetic and logical operations
Simple instruction set architecture (ISA)
Basic control unit and datapath
Simulation and testing environment
Components
ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit): Performs arithmetic and logical operations.
Registers: Temporary storage for data and instructions.
Control Unit: Decodes instructions and controls the datapath.
Memory: Stores instructions and data.
Datapath: The path through which data flows in the processor.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
To work with this project, you will need the following tools:

Verilog or VHDL for hardware description
ModelSim or any other compatible simulator for testing and simulation
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/zahidaof/Simple-8-bit-processor.git
cd Simple-8-bit-processor
Open the project in your preferred HDL editor or IDE.

Running the Simulation
Open the simulation tool (e.g., ModelSim).
Compile the HDL files.
Load the testbench file.
Run the simulation and observe the waveforms.
Usage
Write your own instructions and load them into the memory module.
Modify the testbench to include your instructions.
Run the simulation to see how your instructions are executed by the processor.
Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you have any ideas or improvements, feel free to fork the repository and create a pull request.
